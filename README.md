# advent_of_code

<insert fun intro about getting started with Advent of Code>

For this project I will be completing each year of Advent of Code with a different programming 
language. This way I won't just program in the easiest to implement language, just doing the 
same thing over and over again for each year. Instead I'll be forced to explore a new language
each time I start a new year. This won't just force me to get back to basics with familiar 
programming languages, but will also be a fun way to get started with new ones.
